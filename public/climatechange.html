            Climate change refers to the change in the environmental conditions of the earth. This happens due to many internal and external factors. The climatic change has become a global concern over the last few decades. Besides, these climatic changes affect life on the earth in various ways. These climatic changes are having various impacts on the ecosystem and ecology. Due to these changes, a number of species of plants and animals have gone extinct.So there's an urgent need to tackle these climate changes.

        <h1 class="sub-head" id="">1. Commit to Using Less Plastic
        </h1>
       <p class="data">Single-use plastic and plastic consumption is seriously damaging to the planet. The excessive use of plastic causes contamination as toxin pollutants are released into the environment. This pollution harms plants, animals, and humans alike and is aggravated by the fact that plastic is not biodegradable so this effect is long-lasting. There are loads of ways you can cut back on plastic day-to-day, from switching to reusable produce bags, to using a reusable coffee cup, to doing your shopping at a plastic-free store if there's one close to you.</p>

       <h1 class="sub-head" id=""> 2. Support Sustainable Fashion
        </h1>
       <p class="data">The fashion industry is one of the biggest contributors to pollution, accounting for 20% of global industrial water pollution, as well as being a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions — according to the World Economic Forum, the fashion industry produces 10% of all humanity's carbon emissions, as well as being the second-largest consumer of the world's water supply. Sustainable fashion, meanwhile, is clothing that is made from environmentally-friendly materials, doesn't harm anyone in the process of making the clothes, and uses natural resources responsibly. Supporting sustainable fashion can seem like the more costly option, but the environmental cost of fast fashion is vast — and there are lots of affordable ways to support sustainable fashion too. You can try, for example, organizing a clothes swap with stylish friends and family to refresh your wardrobes without buying anything new, or going thrift shopping for a dope fit, or trying out online market places like Depop

       <h1 class="sub-head" id="">  3. Control Global Warming</h1>
       <p class="data">There are many changes we can bring about in our life both big and small to prevent global warming and save our planet. Firstly, we must stop deforestation in all forms. Do not cut down more trees as it will only worsen the level of carbon dioxide in the air. Instead, encourage people to plant even more trees to create a fine balance in nature. Moreover, it reduces the usage of energy everywhere. It does not matter if you are at your home or at your office, the higher the energy used the more the carbon dioxide produced. Thus, do not waste electricity as it requires the burning of fossil fuels. As a result of the burning of fossil fuels, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increase rapidly and contribute to global warming. Moreover, reduce the carbon footprint and do not travel through planes that often. Most importantly, replace all your ordinary bulbs with LED lights. It will help in reducing the use of energy by a massive amount. Similarly, do not waste that energy. Instead of becoming more dependent, we need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and electricity right away. Opt for eco-friendly options like solar energy and win power. Take up the habit of recycling and reusing. Do not throw away things instead learn to reuse them properly. Further, carpool with your neighbors and relatives to not contribute to automobile exhausts and emissions..</p>

       <h1 class="sub-head" id="">  4. Adopt a More Plant-Based Diet:</h1>
       <p class="data">Going plant-based is a trend that has really picked up over the last few years, and one of the simplest ways you can help tackle climate change this year is by adopting a more plant-based diet, or making plant-based choices. Not only is this a healthier alternative for your body, but research shows that a global shift to a more plant-based diet could reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases by 70% by 2050. Meat and dairy products generally demand more resources and higher emissions than plant-based choices.</p>
